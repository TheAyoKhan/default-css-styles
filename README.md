# default-css-styles

These are the styles I'll use for when I'm making an website or something like that.

## Why was this made?

Because why not.

Seriously though, why have a gigantico bunch of text in my CSS file that I need to copy every time when I can just bring all of this by `@importing` them.

## Why is this public?

So other people, like you, can use my stylings too! I've separated the reset and the actual stylings in case someone doesn't want the reset too.

Enjoy! â˜º
